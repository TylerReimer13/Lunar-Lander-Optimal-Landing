# Lunar-Lander-Optimal-Landing
Python simulation of a mass-varying lunar lander that plots a trajectory to minimize control effort (customizable).
Optimal trajectory is found by transforming the control problem into a NonLinear Program (NLP), then solving the NLP with the direct shooting method in the Casadi library
